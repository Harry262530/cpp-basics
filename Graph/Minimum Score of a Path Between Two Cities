You are given a positive integer n representing n cities numbered from 1 to n. You are also given a 2D array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi, distancei] indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities ai and bi with a distance equal to distancei. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.

The score of a path between two cities is defined as the minimum distance of a road in this path.

Return the minimum possible score of a path between cities 1 and n.

Note:

A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
It is allowed for a path to contain the same road multiple times, and you can visit cities 1 and n multiple times along the path.
The test cases are generated such that there is at least one path between 1 and n.
 

Example 1:


Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,9],[2,3,6],[2,4,5],[1,4,7]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 4. The score of this path is min(9,5) = 5.
It can be shown that no other path has less score.
Example 2:


Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,2],[1,3,4],[3,4,7]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4. The score of this path is min(2,2,4,7) = 2.



Approach : 
We need to traverse the graph starting from 1 to all connected node and get the shortest path linked to each node we visit.
No need to worry about target, as it is given that there must be a ptah to the target.

Algo:
1. Create a weighted graph.
2. Run BFS from 1
3. which every node encountered, check for all the path liked to the nodes for sortest one; irrespective of it is got visited or not.
